# Thing before others
  Actually, it is not potato, it is masked potato salad. But this name is too
  long. so just call it potato. But only one potato is such alone, so let it
  called potatos finally.
  However I feel it great and potatos will feel happy. What do you think?

At the very beginning, dpdk-2.2.0 was chosen because it was a publish version shipped with official CentOS 7.3 . But I don't know why my VM will be stuck on
under function rte_eal_init(), however turn to dpdk-16.07.2 and it works fine.
